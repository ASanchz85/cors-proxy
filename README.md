# CORS-PROXY

This small script has been created to overpass cors policies acting as a proxy server. Only with modifying the target and set it up to yours, you'll be able to use it.

## Chrome for devs

As an alternative, there's a way to disable chrome policies regarding cors and allowing you to test your apps without those issues. 

```sh
chrome.exe --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:\ChromeDev"
```



**Happy coding!**
